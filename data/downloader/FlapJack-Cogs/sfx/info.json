    "DESCRIPTION" : "sfx when?\n\nInject sound effects or custom text-to-speech into voice channels, without breaking existing music streams. A collaboration with a little bit of tmerc's sound effects code, and a little bit of FlapJack's magic spaghetti code. Just kidding, it was hard work. At present, it works with the core audio cog, and *should* respect any other playing voice client as well.\n\nThis cog is backwards compatible with playsound! Just rename (don't forget to back it up!) your /data/playsound/ folder to /data/sfx/.\n\nDependencies: gTTS :: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gTTS (for TTS functions only, cog should still load without it)",
