    "SHORT" : "Self-role functionality with single-membership role sets.",
    "DESCRIPTION" : "This cog allows you to specify 'role sets', which are groups of roles to which a member can assign only one to themselves at a time. When one role is added, any others in that group are removed. There is also the toggle command, which will either toggle a single-length roleset on or off, or between two roles in a roleset (they must already have one in order to toggle).",
