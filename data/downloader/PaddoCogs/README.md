# PaddoCogs
PaddoInWonderland's Cogs for Red-DiscordBot. Red-DiscordBot is a multipurpose bot for Discord developed by Twentysix26.
To submit an idea for a cog, DM me on discord. You can always find me at the official server for Red. You can also find me at the official support server for Red-DiscordBot here: https://discord.gg/TpF2SVJ

Sadly, making and maintaining these cogs costs time, but no money. They're all made in my free time when I'm not doing anything else. But if you have PayPal, and you like my cogs, would you kindly think about donating some spare change by following the following link: https://paypal.me/PaddoInWonderland I thank you. :)
